Replica set :
 Replica set is next generation of replication controller , it ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.
 if pod is goes down or deleted , REplicaSet automaticallly created new pod , to maintain desired state.
Key Features:
Ensures high availability of pods.
Supports self-healing of pods (if one fails, another is spawned).
Works underneath a Deployment, which manages updates and rollbacks.
Uses selectors to match the pods it should manage.

Real-Time Usage in Projects
In production, ReplicaSets are rarely used alone. They are used and managed by Deployments, which provide rolling updates and rollback capabilities. However, understanding ReplicaSet is crucial for troubleshooting and controlling pod behavior manually.

| ‚ùå Pods not getting created  | ReplicaSet shows desired count, but 0 running pods         | Check events (`kubectl describe rs`) for imagePullErrors, resource constraints, etc. |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Wrong label selectors    | ReplicaSet not managing any pod                            | Ensure that `spec.selector.matchLabels` matches `template.metadata.labels`           |
| üîÅ Excess pods              | Manually created pods with matching labels are not removed | ReplicaSet adopts these pods but doesn‚Äôt delete them                                 |

| üö´ Resource limits exceeded | Pod fails to schedule due to insufficient resources        | Check node capacity and `kubectl describe pod` for scheduling issues                 |
| üíÄ Orphaned pods            | ReplicaSet deleted but pods still exist                    | Check if pods were manually created or owned by another resource                     |

Q1: What happens if you manually delete a pod created by a ReplicaSet?
Answer: The ReplicaSet will immediately create a new pod to maintain the desired replica count. This ensures availability.
 Q2: You deployed a ReplicaSet, but no pods are running. What do you check?
Answer:
kubectl describe rs <replicaSet-name> for events
Check if the selector.matchLabels matches template.metadata.labels
Verify image correctness (typos, access permissions)
Check for node resource availability
Q3: You created a ReplicaSet with 3 replicas, but 4 pods are running. Why?
Answer: Likely a manually created pod with matching labels was adopted by the ReplicaSet. It sees 3 desired but counts the extra pod, so it doesn‚Äôt delete it unless you manually intervene.
 Q4: Can two ReplicaSets manage the same pod?
Answer: No. A pod can be managed by only one ReplicaSet at a time based on label selectors. If label selectors of multiple ReplicaSets match a pod, it may lead to conflicts during creation, but ownership is assigned to only one.
Q5: What‚Äôs the difference between a ReplicaSet and a Deployment?
Answer:
A ReplicaSet maintains a specific number of pod replicas.
A Deployment manages ReplicaSets and provides update strategies (rolling updates, rollback, etc.).
In real projects, Deployments are preferred over manually managing ReplicaSets

| Check RS status       | `kubectl get rs`                                  | View current replica count       |
| Describe RS           | `kubectl describe rs <name>`                      | Check events, errors, labels     |
| Check pod logs        | `kubectl logs <pod>`                              | Debug application issues         |
| Check pod status      | `kubectl get pods -o wide`                        | View scheduling and node issues  |
| Check selectors       | Confirm `matchLabels` and `template.labels` match |                                  |
| Check resource limits | `kubectl describe pod <pod>`                      | Look for insufficient CPU/memory |


Real-World Challenges
1. ReplicaSet not scaling pods
Caused by incorrect label selectors.
Misconfigured resouce requests/limits.
2. Pods fail to start even when RS is healthy
Issues lie inside the container (application crash, dependency failure).
Use kubectl logs and kubectl exec to debug.
3. Pods scheduled on same node causing resource contention
Use affinity/anti-affinity or nodeSelector for better distribution.


Scenario-Based Interview Questions
üîπ Q1: Why would you prefer a ReplicaSet over a ReplicationController?
Answer: Because ReplicaSet supports advanced label selectors and integrates with Deployments for rolling updates and rollbacks, which are not available in ReplicationControllers.

üîπ Q2: Can we use ReplicationController in Kubernetes today?
Answer: Yes, but it‚Äôs deprecated in practice. For new applications or upgrades, use ReplicaSet or Deployment.

üîπ Q3: What happens if your labels don‚Äôt match in either controller?
Answer: No pods will be created or managed. Always ensure that the selector matches the template.labels.
