What is a Service in Kubernetes?
 In Kubernetes, a Service is an object that exposes a set of Pods as a network service. It gives a stable way to communicate with Pods, even though Pods can come and go (because they are dynamically created/destroyed).

service Types
=============
1. clusterIP
2. NodePort
3. Load balancer


1. Cluster IP

It is the default type of service in Kubernetes.
It creates a virtual IP address (called ClusterIP) that is only accessible inside the cluster.
This means only other Pods inside the same cluster can talk to this service.

How it works :

1.When you create a service, Kubernetes gives it a ClusterIP (virtual IP).
2.This ClusterIP gets registered in the internal DNS (kube-dns or CoreDNS).
3.So, other Pods can talk to your service using just the service name (no need to remember IP addresses).
4.The kube-proxy running on each node helps in redirecting traffic from this virtual IP to the correct backend Pods.
