cenario 1: Deny All Ingress Traffic to a Pod
Question:
You want to ensure that no external pod or service can access a backend pod. What type of network policy would you apply?

Answer:
Create a NetworkPolicy with an empty ingress rule, like below:

yaml
Copy
Edit
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress: []
This will deny all inbound traffic to the pods labeled app=backend.

ðŸŽ¯ Scenario 2: Allow Ingress Only from a Specific Namespace
Question:
You want to allow traffic to a pod only from a pod in the frontend namespace. How would you do that?

Answer:

yaml
Copy
Edit
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: frontend
This uses a namespaceSelector to restrict traffic from other namespaces.

ðŸŽ¯ Scenario 3: Pod Cannot Resolve DNS
Question:
After applying a NetworkPolicy, your pod canâ€™t resolve domain names. What could be the issue?

Answer:
Most likely, the egress rule is blocking DNS (UDP on port 53). To fix:

yaml
Copy
Edit
egress:
- to:
  - ipBlock:
      cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
  ports:
  - protocol: UDP
    port: 53
ðŸŽ¯ Scenario 4: Restrict Pod Egress to Internet but Allow Internal Cluster Communication
Question:
How would you restrict pods from accessing the internet but allow them to communicate with other pods in the same cluster?

Answer:
Use an egress policy that only allows traffic to cluster IP ranges (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16):

yaml
Copy
Edit
egress:
- to:
  - ipBlock:
      cidr: 10.0.0.0/16
This blocks external access but allows internal cluster communication.

ðŸŽ¯ Scenario 5: Multi-Tenant Isolation
Question:
You have two teams working in separate namespaces. How can you isolate them so that pods in one namespace can't access pods in the other?

Answer:
Apply a deny-all policy in each namespace and then selectively allow traffic only within the same namespace.
