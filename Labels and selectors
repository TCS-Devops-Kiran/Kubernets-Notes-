labels :
Labels are key-value pairs that are attached to Kubernetes objects like Pods, Services, ReplicaSets, Deployments, etc.
Purpose of Labels:
*Organize and group resources.
*Select a subset of objects.
*Filter logs or metrics.
*Attach metadata for CI/CD pipelines, environments, teams, versions

Synatx:
metadata:
 name : nginx
 namespace : prod
 labels:
  app: web-dev
Selectors:
Selectors are used to filter the k8s objectives based on labels
Syntax:
  apiVersion:V1
  Kind : Service
  metadata:
   name : nginx
   namespace : Prod
spec:
 type : ClusterIP  # This is the default type for services
 selectors:
   ports:
     protocol: TCP
      port: 80  # Service port
      targetPort: 80  # The port on the container


Interview Questions:
1. To see the labels
    kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <Name-space>
2.How to display only labels?
    kubectl get po <podname> -n <namespace> --show -labels
3.How to see node and pod ip?
    kubectl get po -n <namespace> -o wide
4.How to go inside of pod?
   kubectl exec -it -n <namespace> javawebapptest -- sh


Common Real-Time Issues with Labels & Selectors
    Issue 1: Selector mismatch
Cause: Wrong or missing labels in Pods or Deployments.
Effect: Services can't discover pods ‚Üí app becomes unreachable.
Fix: Use kubectl get pods --show-labels to inspect.

üîç Issue 2: Duplicate or wrong label keys
Cause: Human error in YAML file.
Effect: Unexpected grouping or selection of pods.
Fix: Lint the YAML or use kubectl label to correct.

üîç Issue 3: Typo in selector
Example: app=feontend instead of frontend.
Fix: Use kubectl describe service <svc-name> to verify selector and compare with pod labels.

üîç Issue 4: Labels not updated
When: During rolling deployments or CI/CD pipelines.
Fix: Reapply updated labels using kubectl label pod ....

‚öîÔ∏è 5. Real-Time Challenges
Challenge	Description	Resolution
‚ùì Label Explosion	Too many labels used across teams/environments	Define naming conventions
üß© Overlapping Selectors	Multiple selectors match the same pod (e.g., metrics + app + debug)	Use distinct labels for orthogonal concerns
üè∑Ô∏è Missing Labels	Developers forget to add labels	Enforce label policies via Gatekeeper (OPA)
üîÅ Selector not updated after label change	Manual label change not reflected in selectors	Automate via CI/CD

üõ†Ô∏è 6. Troubleshooting Steps
‚úÖ Step-by-step:
1.Check Pod Labels:
kubectl get pods --show-labels
2.Check Selector of the Service/Deployment:
    kubectl describe service <svc-name>
3.Manually Match Pods:
kubectl get pods -l app=frontend,environment=prod
4.Add Missing Labels:
kubectl label pod <pod-name> app=frontend environment=prod
5.Verify Service Endpoints:
kubectl get endpoints
üéØ 7. Real-Time Scenario-Based Interview Questions & Answers
Q1: A service is not routing traffic to any pods. What will you check?
Answer:
Verify the labels on the pods using kubectl get pods --show-labels.
Check the selector of the service using kubectl describe service <svc-name>.
Ensure there's label-selector match.
Use kubectl get endpoints to see if the service has any backing pods.

Q2: You updated the label on a pod but the service still doesn't route. Why?
Answer:
The pod label change may not have taken effect, or the label was only applied to one pod.
If the pod is part of a ReplicaSet, it might get replaced with an old-labeled pod.
Always update the label on the Deployment or ReplicaSet, not just the pod.

Q3: How do you list all pods with label app=backend in QA namespace?
kubectl get pods -n qa -l app=backend
Q4: How do you select all pods that do NOT have the label env=prod?
kubectl get pods --selector='env!=prod'
Q5: A developer says their pod is not part of the Deployment's replica set. How do you validate?
Answer:
Check the pod's ownerReference using:
kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o jsonpath='{.metadata.ownerReferences[*].name}'
Ensure pod has matching labels used in the Deployment selector.
If not, it‚Äôs an orphan pod and may need to be deleted or relabeled.

Element	Purpose	Example
Label	Metadata for resources	app=frontend
Selector	Filters resources based on label	selector: app=frontend
Used In	Pods, Services, ReplicaSets, etc	Label pods, select via svc
